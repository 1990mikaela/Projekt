# Project Title

Chatbot for Mental Health

## Summary

This project aims to create a chatbot that provides mental health support and resources to individuals in need. The chatbot will be able to understand user queries and provide relevant responses, resources, and hotlines to help individuals cope with mental health issues.


## Background

Mental health issues are a growing concern globally, with many people struggling to find the right resources and support. The chatbot will address this problem by providing a convenient and accessible way for individuals to seek help and connect with mental health professionals.

## How is it used?

he chatbot will be available 24/7, allowing users to access it at any time. Users can initiate a conversation with the chatbot by typing a message or asking a question. The chatbot will respond with relevant information, resources, and hotlines to help individuals cope with mental health issues.


## Data sources and AI methods
The chatbot will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. The data sources for the chatbot will include mental health resources, hotlines, and articles from reputable sources.


## Challenges

The chatbot will not be able to provide personalized therapy or counseling, as it is not a substitute for human interaction. Additionally, the chatbot may not be able to handle sensitive or emergency situations, requiring users to seek professional help.

## What next?

To further develop the chatbot, we could integrate it with wearable devices or mobile apps to provide more personalized support. Additionally, we could expand the chatbot's capabilities to include additional features such as mood tracking or emotional analysis.
